Process Management

**cmd

systemd is a first process start when we start the application & it's PID is 1.

ps - > report a snapshot a current process 
top -> shows live status of process
ps -elf  -> This provides a more concise output, focusing on essential information like process ID, 
user, CPU time, memory usage, and command name.
sleep 1000 (seconds) -> system will be go for next 1000 seconds
ctrl + z -> to stop above process
sleep 1000 & -> to run process in background (use &) 
jobs - to check jobs 
ps -aux ->  to check currently running process and more info about it.
ps -aux |grep sleep -> 
kill PI - > to kill the running process

------------------------------------------------------------------------
ps -aux vs ps -elf 

Both commands show all running processes.
BSD style (ps -aux) provides more comprehensive information.
SysV style (ps -elf) provides a concise output.
Both are generally accepted on modern systems.
Refer to the ps man page for specific details on your system.
