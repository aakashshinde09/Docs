umask   -> to determine or set file permission of newly created file (full permission - default permission) = umask

how to set permanent umask?
--------------------
lin count
 
by default directory lin count is 2 & for file is 1 ( when we create new file count is always +1 )
 
(check directory lin count in /boot )  using ls cmd


mkdir -p -> to create directory in parent directory when you are present in same directory

--------------

Hardlink & softlink

ln file.name hard_link  -> to create a hardlink of file

we can't create hardlink of directory but we can create softlink of both

softlink is file or directory path link like shortcut key of windows

ln -s /root/dir/ /opt/soft_link 

softlink lin count is always 1 of directory & file 

data  is replecate in hardlink & softlink

deleting original file or directory then hardlink or softlink is useless & its reveres if deleted hardlink or softlink


-----------
**hardlink** 
inod number always same




**softlink**
inod number will change
