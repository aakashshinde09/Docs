1.host windows instance and use rdp to connect                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  2.create ami of ubuntu OS host NGNIX page. share AMI to mumbai and Oregon  region. also make it public

3.create snapshot of your instance.create volume with that snapshot attch to your diffrent instance also create lifecycle policy for snapshot.  

4.create a security group add ssh,http,and https.launch instance attach security group also asign ilastic ip to that instance   

5.create universal globale key for all your regions and launch intance with that key also take ssh with same private key                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    

6.create application load balancer add multiple target group it should be able to balance load to diffrent instance in difrent availability zone.

7.create autoscaling group add multiple target group also add APP load balancer on it so that it should be able to distrubute load equaly.
